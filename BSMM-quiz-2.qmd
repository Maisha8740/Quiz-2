# Instructions

::: callout-important
To access Github from the lab, you will need to make sure you are logged in as follows:

-   username: **.\\daladmin**
-   password: **Business507!**

Remember to

-   create your PAT using `usethis::create_github_token()` ,
-   store your PAT with `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` ,
-   set your username and email with
    -   `usethis::use_git_config( user.name = ___, user.email = ___)`
:::

## Overview

Quiz 1 will be released on Monday, November 20, and is designed to be completed in 30 minutes.

The exam will consist of two parts:

1.  **Part 1 - Conceptual:** Simple questions designed to evaluate your familiarity with the written course notes.
2.  **Part 2 - Applied:** Data analysis in RStudio (like a usual lab, but simpler).

Log in to your github account and then go to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/bsmm-8740-fall-2023) for the course and find the **BSMM-8740-quiz-2-\[your github username\]** repository to complete the quiz.

Create an R project using your quiz-2 repository (remember to create a PAT, etc., as in lab-1) and add your answers by editing the `BSMM-quiz-2.qmd` file in your repository.

## Academic Integrity

By taking this exam, you pledge to that:

-   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;

-   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and

-   I will act if the Standard is compromised.

## Rules & Notes

-   This is an individual assignment. Everything in your repository is for your eyes only.

-   You may not collaborate or communicate anything about this exam to **anyone** except the instructor. For example, you may not communicate with other students or post/solicit help on the internet, email or via any other method of communication.

-   The exam is open-book, open-note, so you may use any materials from class as you take the exam.

## Submission

-   Your answers should be typed in the document below

-   Make sure you **commit** any changes and [**push**]{.underline} the changes to the course repository before the end of the quiz.

-   Once the quiz has ended, the contents of your repository will be pulled for grading. This will happen only once, so no changes made after the end of the quiz will be recorded.

# Quiz-2 (part 1 **-** conceptual)

## Q-1

**(1 point)** Suppose you had an energy usage dataset for homes with the following columns:

| Col1 (numeric) | Col2 (string)    | Col3 (numeric) | Col4 (numeric) |
|----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| sq_foot        | location_lat_lon | year_built     | kwh_per_year   |

What type of algorithm would you use the predict the kilowatt hours used per year for a newly constructed house?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   unsupervised learning
-   supervised learning
:::

## Q-2

**(1 point)** Suppose you had a flight dataset with the following columns:

| Col1 (string)  | Col2 (string) | Col3 (date) | Col4 (string) | Col5 (string) | Col6 (numeric) | Col7 (numeric)     |
|----------|----------|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| depart_airport | dest_airport  | date        | time_of_day   | airline_code  | fuel_price     | ticket_price_coach |

Based on the dataset, could you train a classification model to classify the cost of a coach ticket as "high," "average," or "low"?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   No. It's not possible to create a classification model. The `coach_ticket_cost` values are numeric not categorical.
-   No. Classification models only predict two categories, like `spam` or `not_spam`. This model would need to predict three categories.
-   Yes, but we'd first need to convert the numeric values in the `coach_ticket_cost` column to categorical values.
:::

## Q-3

**(1 point)** What are two examples of classification? Select two answers.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the answers you don't select:*

-   Determine when a heater is on or off based on temperature data
-   Translate the numbers or letters from a handwritten message to ASCII text
-   Develop a mathematical relationship between heater level (0-100%) and temperature (20-70¬∞C)
-   Safety override that automatically shuts off equipment when it is too hot
:::

## Q-4

**(1 point)** What is the main goal of a clustering algorithm?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   To predict the category or class of an instance
-   To group similar instances based on their features
-   To reduce the number of features in a dataset
-   To find the central point of a dataset
:::

## Q-5

**(1 point)** Which algorithm is commonly used for clustering?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   Linear Regression
-   K-Means
-   Naive Bayes
-   Random Forest

# Quiz-2 (part 2 - applied)

## Q-6

**(1 point)** What does the following R code do?

``` r
model_spec <- parsnip::logistic_reg() %>% parsnip::set_engine("glm")
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   Prepares a logistic regression model using the random forest algorithm
-   Specifies a logistic regression model using the glm engine
-   Creates a decision tree model
-   Specifies a random forest model
:::

## Q-7

**(1 point)** What procedure does the following R code perform?

``` r
parsnip::nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 3) %>% parsnip::set_engine("kknn")
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   Specifies a k-means clustering model with 3 clusters
-   Specifies a k-nearest neighbors model with 3 neighbors
-   Sets up a 3-fold cross-validation for k-means clustering
-   Prepares a hierarchical clustering model with 3 clusters
:::

## Q-8

**(1 point)** Analyze this `tidymodels` code for classification. What is missing for it to run correctly?

``` r
model_spec <- 
  parsnip::rand_forest(trees = 100) %>% 
  parsnip::set_mode("classification")
fit <- model_spec %>% 
  parsnip::fit(Species ~ ., data = train_data)
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

*Delete the wrong answer(s):*

-   Normalizing the data before fitting the model
-   Defining the train_data variable
-   Setting the engine for the random forest model
-   Specifying the number of folds for cross-validation
:::

## Q-9

**(2 points)** Write R code using `tidymodels` to perform a 10-fold cross-validation for a logistic regression model on the `mpg` dataset from the `ggplot2` package. Include data preprocessing steps in the recipe.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER :

```{r}
